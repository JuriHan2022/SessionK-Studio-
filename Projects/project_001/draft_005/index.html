    <h6>Your eye, first of all, would glide over the grey fitted carpet </h6>
    <h5>In the narrow, long and high-ceilinged corridor. Its walls would be cupboards,  </h5>
    <h4>In light-colored wood, with fittings of gleaming brass. Three prints, depticting respectively;</h4>
    <h3>The Derby winner Thunderbird, a paddle-steamer named Ville-de-Montereau,and a Stephenson locomotive  </h3>
    <h2>Would lead to a leather curtain hanging on thick, black, grainy wooden rings which would </h2>

    <p> by three faded rugs.</p>

  On the left, in a kind of recess, 
  there would be a large sofa upholstered in worn black leather with pale cherrywood bookcases on either side,
  heaped with books in untidy piles above the sofa, a mariner’s chart would fil the whole length of that section of the wall. On the other side of a small low table, 
  and beneath a silk prayer-mat nailed to the wall with three large-headed brass studs, matching the leather curtain,
  there would be another sofa, at right angles to the first, with a light-brown velvet covering; it would lead on to 
 a small and spindly piece of furniture, lacquered in dark red and providing rhee-display shelves for knick-knacks:
 <h3>agates and stone eggs, snuffboxes, candy boxes, jade ashtray, a mother-of-pearl oyster shell, a silver fob watch,
  a cut glass, a crystal pyramid, a miniature in an oval frame.</h3>> Further on, beyond a padded door, there would be shelving
  on both sides of the corner, for caskets and for records, beside a closed gramophone of which only four machined-steel 
  knobs would be visible,

</div>
<div>
  and above it,<br> a print depicting The Great Parade of the Military Tattoo. <br>
Through the window, <br> draped with white and brown curtains in cloth imitating: 
<br><h3>Jouy wallpaper,</h3>


</div>
<div>
  <br><br><br><br>you would glimpse a few trees, a tiny park abit of street. A rolltop desk
  littered with peppers and pen-holders would go with a small cane-seated chair. 
  
</div>
<div>
  On a console table 
</div>
<div>

 would be a telephone, a leather diary, a writing pad. Then, on the other side of another door, beyond a low, square revolving bookcase

  supporting a large, cylindrical vase decorated in blue and filled with yellow roses, set beneath an oblong mirror in a 
  
</div>
<div>
  <br><br>mahogany frame, 

  there would be  a narrow table with its two benches upholstered in tartan, which would bring your eye back to the leather curtain.
   
  
</div>
<div>

	It would be all in browns, ochers, duns and yellows: a world of slightly dull colours, in carefully graded shades, calculated with almost too much artistry, in the midst of which would be some striking, brighter splashes - a cushion in almost garish orange,


</div>
<div>

  a few multicoloured book jackets
  amongst the leather-bound volumes.
</div>
</div>

<div class= "class35">  During the day, the light flooding in would make this room seem a little sad, despite the roses. It would be an evening room. But in the winter, with the curtains drawn, some spots illuminated - the bookcase corner, the record shelves, the desk, the low table between the two settees, and the vague reflections in the mirror and the large expanses in shadow, whence all the things would gleam - the polished wood, the rich eheavy silks the cut glass , the softened leather - it would be a haven of peace, a land of happiness.
</div>


<div class="section4">   
<div>
  The first door would open onto a bedroom, its floor covered with a light-coloured fitted carpet. 
  An English double bed would fill the whole rear part of it. On the right, to both sides of the window, 
  there would be tall and narrow sets of shelves holding a few books, to be read and read again, photograph albums,
  packs of cards, pots, necklaces, paste jewellery. To the left, an old oak wardrobe and two clothes horses of wood 
  and brass would stand opposite a small wing-chair upholstered in thin -striped grey silk and a dressing table. 
  Through a half -open door giving on to a bedroom you would glimpse thick bathrobes, swan-neck taps in solid brass,
  a large adjustable mirror, a pair of cut throught razors and their green leather sheaths, bottles horn-handled brushes, 
  sponges. The bedroom walls would be papered with chintz;
<br>the bedspread would be a tartan blanket. A bedside table, with an openwork copper band running round three of its sides,
 would support a silver candlestick lamp topped with a very pale grey silk shade, a square carrige clock, a rose in stream vase,
 and on its lower shelf, folded newspapers and some magazines. Further on at the foot of the bed, there would be a big prouf in
natural hide. At the window. The gauze curtains would side on brass rods; the thick woolen double curtains would be half drawn. 
In the half light the room would still be bright. On the wall, above the bed made up and turned down for the night, between two 
small wall lamps, the astonishing, long, narrow black and white photograph of a bird in the sky would surprise you by its slightly
formal perfection. 
</div>
<div>
  The second door would reveal a study. From top to bottom the walls would be lined with books and periodicals with, here and 
  there, so as to break the continuity of bindings and jackets, a number of prints, drawings, and photographs - Antonello da
   Messina’s Saint Jerome, a detail from The Triumph of Saint George, one of Piranesi’s dungneous, a portrait by Ingres, 
   a little pen -and-ink landscape by Klee, a sepia-tint photograph of Renan in his room a the College de France, a Steinberg
    department store, Cranch’s Melanchthon-pinned to wooden panels set into shelving. Slightly to the left of the window at a 
    shallow angle would be a long country table covered with a large red blotter wooden boxes, falte pen-holders and pots of all
    kinds would hold pencils, paper-clips, staples, large and small. A glass tile would serve as an ashtray. A circular black 
    leather box decorated with gold leaf arabesques would be filled with cigarettes. Light would come from an old desk lamp, 
    adjustable only with difficulty, fitted with a green opaline lamp shade shaped live a visor. On each side of the table, 
    virtually facing each other, would be two high-backed wood and leather armchairs. Still further to the left, along the wall, 
    would be a narrow table overflowing with books. A wing-chair in the bottle-green leather would lead to grey metal fitting 
    carpets and light wooden card-index boxes. On a third even smaller table would be a sweedish lamp and a typewriter under
    its canvas dust-cover. Right at the back would be a narrow bed covered in ultramarine velvet and stacked with cushions
    of all colors. On a painted wooden stand, almost in the middle of the room, there would be a globe made of papier-mache
    by the red curtain at the window, would be an oiled-wood ladder which could slide on a bass rail all the way round the 
    room.
