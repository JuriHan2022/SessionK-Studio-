<h3>Other random facts</h3>
  <p>I don't know what I am doing. I have so many interest it feels wiered when people ask me what I want to do. I mean I want to do a lot of things: I want to be a graphic designer, I want to work in Bloomburg but other times I want to be a beauty youtuber. I mean nothing is easy but I honestly think I have to live too long to be satisified with doing one job. <em>Having money and not working</em> also seems like an ideal life but also many say <em>money without purpose</em> is an empty life. But is it? Our world is constructed on money----<strong>who has money has power</strong> Anyways this was me rambling on my random thoughts this is who I am how I think and what I want to be.
